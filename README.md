# AD wordings generator

## Description
ADWG is a script and a set of strapi queries that are built to facilitate and automatize the process of wordings integration.

## Features 
- Generate wordings based on the strapi content
- Fetches static files for backups

## How to use
- run `npm install`

To integrate a new query you can follow the following steps
- Add the query to queries folder (try to have the same query from the frontoffice)
- Add a json object to config.json where you define the following : 
```
{
  "queryName": "MrePageQuery",
  "exportName": "MREPage",
  "path": "out/MrePage"
},

queryName   : is the name of the query from the front office 
exportName  : is the name that will be used in the generated translation files 
path        : is the destination of the wordings
```

- In the `queryMap` in the file `script.ts` Import and add the integrated query

Then you can run the script by typing the following command : 
```
npm run launch
```
- Check if the wordings are generated in the out directory

And voila
